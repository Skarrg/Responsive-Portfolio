                    I've been working in the Video game industry for 13 years now in various roles.
                <br>
                    I'm married to my phenomenal wife, Alice, and we have one loud screaming demon (cat) named
                    Wednesday.
                <br>
                    I've been feeling listless and bored at work so I decided to join this boot camp to increase my
                    skills and manuever better in my life.
                <br>
                    I'm definitely going to have more games here in the future. In Github in general, not as in for this homework assignment.
